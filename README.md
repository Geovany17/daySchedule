# daySchedule

This day planner allows the user to enter and save a task in each hour block. The blocks are color-coded to let the user know which events have passed, are happening, and are coming up. The user's inputs are saved to the page using local storage.
This app was made as a homework for Penn LPS bootcamp.
This is a work daily schedule application, built using HTML, CSS,Javascript and JQuery.
This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages.
